This Project consist in analyze three different types of archives and Wrangle this data. To complete this process we will gather, assess, clean and store the new data for visualization and analysis. The dataset for this task is from Twitter account WeRateDogs that rates people's dog with a lot of humor, showing funny pictures and comments and a unique rating level. The purpose of this task is to put in practice what I learned in the lesson of Data Wrangling from Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree.

- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/)
- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/contents.html)
- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/index.html)
- [Tweepy API](https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy)

After installing all these libraries in the Anaconda environment, you just need to run the jupyter notebook files (*wrangle_act.ipynb*, *wrangle_report.ipynb* and *act_report.ipynb*) to check this analysis.
